# Advanced Programming Using Java

Java scripts of the assignments completed in 'Advanced Programming for Bioinformatics' course. 

The goals accomplished in this course were:
- Implementing thread safe multi-threaded algorithms in Java.
- Understanding synchronization of data structures.
- Designing software that avoids common problems in multi-core programming including data corruption, thread
starvation and deadlock.
- Applying these implementations to the large datasets of post-genomic biology.
